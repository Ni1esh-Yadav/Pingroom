# Pingroom

Pingroom is a live video chat application designed **exclusively for developers**. Think of it as a networking tool where developers can randomly connect with other developers around the world and collaborate instantly ‚Äî like Omegle, but only for the dev community. 

## Motivation

In today‚Äôs world, developers often struggle to find like-minded people to collaborate with, discuss projects, or simply network. While platforms like GitHub, LinkedIn, or Discord help in showcasing work and building communities, they lack the **instant face-to-face connection** that helps spark real-time collaboration.

Pingroom solves this problem by enabling developers to **instantly connect via text or video chat**, without the hassle of creating accounts or setting up communities. Whether you want to find a coding buddy, discuss ideas, or network casually, Pingroom creates a developer-only space for meaningful connections.
